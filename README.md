# Contact-Management-System--CMS-
A lightweight C++ console app to add, view, and search personal contacts with phone, name, address, and description. It uses CSV file storage for data persistence and portability via simple file I/O operations. The menu-driven interface helps practice C++ file handling, OOP, and basic data management.
